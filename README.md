# Terminal: A Text Adventure on your Software Hero’s Journey
Command Line can seem scary for new joiners to Software Development World, 
but it has not to be that way with the proper mentorship. 
The workshop is intended to provide a pretty introduction to its capabilities 
Let's cross the threshold and face some trials, meet your allies and unmask some enemies in this “magic” world.

## The Hero's Journey
This is one of the most common narrative ways used to story telling created by [Joseph Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey#:~:text=In%20narratology%20and%20comparative%20mythology,comes%20home%20changed%20or%20transformed.). 
Some famous films and books and even video games such as The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars and Chrono Trigger 
take it as a base for creating their atmosphere and for letting people to experience of winning against the most fiery challenges.

## Software Development
Have you ever face a situation that challenges you to enter to a unknown world?
I faced it when I was on college and my laptop died and the only Operative System I could install it was [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).
It was a very good opportunity to learn some command line commands in order to be able to use an external monitor.

Recently I had needed to work on a remote environment with no GUI. And I know I will be there are more challenges coming.
